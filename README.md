# React Native Projects

I have started working on React Native, and this repository will showcase all my projects, ranging from basic to advanced levels. My approach is to first focus on **frontend-only** projects, mastering the essential aspects of UI/UX and app functionality in React Native.

Once I am comfortable with the frontend, I will then move on to **full-stack** React Native projects, integrating both frontend and backend components to build fully functional mobile applications.

This repository will be updated regularly as I continue to explore and improve my React Native skills.
## Project 1: Card Component

In my first project, I created a **Card Component** in React Native. This component is reusable and allows you to display a card with an image, title, and description. The card is designed with styling for layout, spacing, and shadow effects to give it a modern, clean look.

### Features:
- **Dynamic data**: The component takes props for `title`, `description`, and `imageSource`.
- **Reusable**: The Card component can be used multiple times with different data.
- **Styling**: Includes a shadow effect, rounded corners, and padding to make the card visually appealing.
- **Image support**: Displays an image using the `Image` component in React Native.
